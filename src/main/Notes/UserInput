-cross eyed scripting attack is someone just entering script into a user input form
    -prevent this by using jstl:
    <c:out value="${book.title}" />
    <c:out value="${book.author}" />

    -so not allowing it to be inserted as script, but as a string, so it wont read it as code




-breaking our programs when a user enters a ' in a contraction or something, becasue it registers it as code
    -using a prepared statement can prevent this



-if youre only making a change the database info, you dont have to redeploy to see the changes
